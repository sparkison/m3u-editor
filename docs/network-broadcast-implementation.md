# Network Broadcast Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the phased implementation of continuous "live" broadcasting for Networks (pseudo-TV channels). The goal is to create channels that broadcast content according to a schedule, just like traditional TV - when you tune in, the show is already playing at the appropriate time.

## What are Networks?

Networks are your own personal TV station that contain your lineups (local media content). They allow you to create custom broadcast channels with scheduled programming from your media library.

### Key Concepts

1. **Media Server Does Transcoding**: Jellyfin/Emby handle hardware-accelerated transcoding. We request streams with specific bitrate/quality parameters.

2. **FFmpeg Concatenates & Segments**: Our FFmpeg process takes the transcoded stream, seeks to the correct position, and outputs HLS segments.

3. **HLS for Continuous Broadcast**: HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) allows clients to join at any time. The `live.m3u8` playlist is continuously updated with new segments.

4. **Schedule-Aware**: The worker knows what should be playing NOW and calculates the seek position into the current programme.

---

## Phase 1: Network Streaming Configuration ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Add configuration fields to the Network model for streaming settings.

### Completed:

1. **Database Migration** (`2026_01_12_000001_add_broadcast_settings_to_networks_table.php`)
   - `broadcast_enabled` - Toggle for enabling broadcast
   - `output_format` - 'hls' or 'mpegts'
   - `segment_duration` - HLS segment length (default 6s)
   - `hls_list_size` - Segments to keep in playlist (default 10)
   - `transcode_on_server` - Let media server transcode
   - `video_bitrate` - kbps (null = source)
   - `audio_bitrate` - kbps (default 192)
   - `video_resolution` - e.g., '1920x1080' (null = source)
   - `broadcast_started_at` - Timestamp when broadcast started
   - `broadcast_pid` - FFmpeg process ID

2. **Global Settings Migration** (`2026_01_12_000001_add_broadcast_settings.php`)
   - `broadcast_max_concurrent` - Max concurrent broadcasting networks (default 10)

3. **Network Model Updates** (`app/Models/Network.php`)
   - Added casts for new fields
   - `isBroadcasting()` - Check if network is currently broadcasting
   - `getHlsStoragePath()` - Get storage path for HLS segments
   - `getCurrentProgramme()` - Get programme that should be playing now
   - `getNextProgramme()` - Get the next scheduled programme
   - `getCurrentSeekPosition()` - Calculate seek position into current programme
   - `getCurrentRemainingDuration()` - Time remaining in current programme
   - Updated `getStreamUrlAttribute()` to return HLS URL when broadcasting
   - Added `getHlsUrlAttribute()`

4. **GeneralSettings Update** (`app/Settings/GeneralSettings.php`)
   - Added `broadcast_max_concurrent` property

5. **Filament UI Update** (`app/Filament/Resources/Networks/NetworkResource.php`)
   - Added "Broadcast Settings" section with:
     - Enable/disable toggle
     - Output format selection (HLS/MPEG-TS)
     - Segment duration configuration
     - Transcoding settings (bitrate, resolution)
     - Advanced HLS settings
     - Broadcast status display

6. **Routes** (`routes/web.php`)
   - Added `/network/{network}/live.m3u8` for HLS playlist
   - Added `/network/{network}/{segment}.ts` for HLS segments

7. **HLS Controller** (`app/Http/Controllers/NetworkHlsController.php`)
   - `playlist()` - Serve live.m3u8 with proper headers
   - `segment()` - Serve .ts segment files

### Testing Checkpoint ✅

- [x] Run migration: `php artisan migrate`
- [x] Can create/edit network with broadcast settings in UI
- [x] Settings persist correctly
- [x] HLS endpoint returns 404/503 (expected - no broadcast running yet)
- [x] Defaults are sensible

---

## Phase 2: Storage & HLS Endpoint ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Set up storage location for HLS segments and create endpoint to serve them.

### Completed:

1. **NetworkFactory** (`database/factories/NetworkFactory.php`)
   - Created factory for Network model
   - Added `broadcasting()` state for enabled broadcast
   - Added `activeBroadcast()` state for running broadcast

2. **Tests** (`tests/Feature/NetworkHlsControllerTest.php`)
   - Created comprehensive test suite for HLS endpoints
   - Tests playlist endpoint (404 disabled, 503 no content, 200 with content)
   - Tests segment endpoint (404 disabled, 404 missing, 200 with content)
   - Tests storage path creation
   - Tests model helper methods (isBroadcasting, getStreamUrlAttribute)

3. **Manual Verification**
   - Created test HLS files in network storage directory
   - Verified playlist endpoint returns correct `Content-Type: application/vnd.apple.mpegurl`
   - Verified segment endpoint returns correct `Content-Type: video/MP2T`
   - Verified 404 when broadcast disabled
   - Verified 503 when broadcast enabled but no playlist

### Storage Structure

```
storage/app/networks/
├── {network-uuid-1}/
│   ├── live.m3u8          # HLS playlist (updated continuously)
│   ├── live000001.ts      # Segment files
│   ├── live000002.ts
│   └── ...
├── {network-uuid-2}/
│   └── ...
```

### HLS Controller

Create `NetworkHlsController` with endpoints:

```php
// Serve the HLS playlist
GET /network/{uuid}/live.m3u8

// Serve individual segments
GET /network/{uuid}/{segment}.ts
```

### Testing Checkpoint

- [ ] Storage directory is created for network
- [ ] HLS playlist endpoint returns 404 (no content yet - expected)
- [ ] Segment endpoint works with test file

---

## Phase 3: FFmpeg Process Management

**Goal**: Create service to spawn and manage FFmpeg processes per network.

### NetworkBroadcastService

Core responsibilities:
1. Start FFmpeg process for a network
2. Monitor process health
3. Stop process gracefully
4. Track running processes

### FFmpeg Command Builder

Build FFmpeg commands that:
1. Request stream from media server at correct seek position
2. Output HLS segments to storage
3. Handle realtime pacing

Example command structure:
```bash
ffmpeg \
  -ss {seek_position} \
  -i "{media_server_stream_url}" \
  -c copy \                              # Copy if server transcoded
  -t {time_until_next_programme} \
  -f hls \
  -hls_time {segment_duration} \
  -hls_list_size {list_size} \
  -hls_flags delete_segments+append_list+program_date_time \
  -hls_segment_filename "{storage_path}/live%06d.ts" \
  "{storage_path}/live.m3u8"
```

### Testing Checkpoint ✅

- [x] Can start FFmpeg process manually via tinker/command
- [x] FFmpeg outputs segments to correct location
- [x] Process can be stopped gracefully
- [x] live.m3u8 is created and updated

---

## Phase 3: FFmpeg Process Management ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Create service to spawn and manage FFmpeg processes per network.

### Completed:

1. **NetworkBroadcastService** (`app/Services/NetworkBroadcastService.php`)
   - `start(Network $network)` - Starts FFmpeg broadcast process
   - `stop(Network $network)` - Gracefully stops broadcast (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL)
   - `isProcessRunning(Network $network)` - Checks if FFmpeg is still running
   - `buildFfmpegCommand()` - Builds FFmpeg command with:
     - Media server stream URL with StartTimeTicks for seeking
     - Duration limit for current programme
     - Video/audio stream mapping (excludes subtitles)
     - HLS output with proper flags
   - `getStatus(Network $network)` - Returns comprehensive status info
   - `cleanupSegments(Network $network)` - Removes old segment files

2. **Key Implementation Details**:
   - Uses media server's native seeking via `StartTimeTicks` parameter
   - Maps only video and audio streams (`-map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:0`) to avoid subtitle issues
   - Supports both copy mode (when media server transcodes) and local transcode
   - Background process via `nohup` with PID tracking
   - Logs FFmpeg output to `{hlsPath}/ffmpeg.log`

3. **Bug Fixes Applied**:
   - Fixed `getCurrentSeekPosition()` and `getCurrentRemainingDuration()` methods in Network model
   - Prioritized `info['media_server_id']` over `source_episode_id` for item ID lookup
   - Fixed duplicate return statement in getStreamUrl

---

## Phase 4: Schedule-Aware Streaming

**Goal**: Make the broadcast worker aware of the schedule and switch content automatically.

### Programme Resolution

```php
// Calculate what should be playing NOW
$currentProgramme = $network->programmes()
    ->where('start_time', '<=', now())
    ->where('end_time', '>', now())
    ->first();

// Calculate seek position
$seekPosition = now()->diffInSeconds($currentProgramme->start_time);

// Calculate remaining duration
$remainingDuration = $currentProgramme->end_time->diffInSeconds(now());
```

### Content Transition Logic

When current programme ends:
1. Current FFmpeg process completes (or is stopped)
2. Next programme is fetched
3. New FFmpeg process starts with new content
4. HLS playlist continues seamlessly (append mode)

### Filler Content

When there's a gap in schedule:
- Use configured filler content (loop a video)
- Or display a "Coming Up" slate
- Or loop network logo

### Testing Checkpoint

### Testing Checkpoint ✅

- [x] Current programme is correctly identified
- [x] Seek position is calculated correctly
- [x] FFmpeg seeks to correct position in video
- [x] Transition to next programme works

---

## Phase 4 & 5: Schedule-Aware Streaming & Background Worker ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**: Create a persistent worker that manages all active network broadcasts.

### Completed:

1. **NetworkBroadcastService Extended** (`app/Services/NetworkBroadcastService.php`)
   - `needsRestart(Network $network)` - Checks if restart is needed
   - `restart(Network $network)` - Stop and start broadcast
   - `tick(Network $network)` - Single iteration of worker loop
   - `getBroadcastingNetworks()` - Get all enabled networks

2. **NetworkBroadcastWorker Command** (`app/Console/Commands/NetworkBroadcastWorker.php`)
   - `php artisan network:broadcast {network?}` - Run for specific or all networks
   - `--once` flag for single tick (useful for cron/testing)
   - `--interval=5` - Configurable tick interval
   - Continuous mode with Ctrl+C support
   - Status display with colorized output

### Usage Examples:

```bash
# Run for all networks continuously
php artisan network:broadcast

# Run for specific network
php artisan network:broadcast 1306afaa-b639-4bdb-a603-5bfff3f81ecc

# Single tick for testing
php artisan network:broadcast --once

# Custom interval (10 seconds)
php artisan network:broadcast --interval=10
```

### Supervisor Configuration

For production, use Supervisor to keep the worker running:

```ini
[program:network-broadcast]
command=php artisan network:broadcast
directory=/var/www/html
autostart=true
autorestart=true
numprocs=1
```

### Testing Checkpoint

- [ ] Command starts and runs continuously
- [ ] Networks start broadcasting automatically
- [ ] Process restarts on content transition
- [ ] Worker handles errors gracefully

---

## Phase 6: Real-Time Monitoring & UI

**Goal**: Add UI to monitor broadcast status and control networks.

### Filament Dashboard Widget

Show:
- Active broadcasts with status
- Current programme info
- Viewer count (if available)
- Stream health indicators

### Control Actions

- Start/Stop broadcast
- Force content refresh
- View logs

### Testing Checkpoint

- [ ] Dashboard shows broadcast status
- [ ] Can start/stop from UI
- [ ] Status updates in real-time

---

## Phase 7: Integration & Polish

**Goal**: Integrate with existing playlist system and polish the feature.

### Playlist Integration

- Network channels in playlist point to HLS endpoint
- EPG reflects actual broadcast schedule
- Failover handling

### Error Handling

- Media server unavailable
- FFmpeg crashes
- Storage full
- Network content exhausted

### Performance Optimization

- Segment cleanup (delete old segments)
- Memory management
- Process pooling limits

### Testing Checkpoint

- [ ] End-to-end test: Create network → Add content → Generate schedule → Start broadcast → Watch in player
- [ ] Stress test multiple networks
- [ ] Recovery from failures

---

## Technical Notes

### Why HLS?

1. **Join Anytime**: Clients can start watching at any segment boundary
2. **Standard Format**: Supported by all IPTV players
3. **Adaptive**: Can support multiple quality levels (future)
4. **HTTP-based**: Works through firewalls, cacheable

### Media Server Transcoding Parameters

Jellyfin/Emby stream URL with transcoding:

```
/Videos/{itemId}/stream.ts?
  VideoBitrate=4000000&
  AudioBitrate=192000&
  MaxWidth=1920&
  MaxHeight=1080&
  VideoCodec=h264&
  AudioCodec=aac&
  api_key={key}
```

### HLS Playlist Format

```m3u8
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-VERSION:3
#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:6
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:142
#EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME:2026-01-12T15:30:00.000Z
#EXTINF:6.000,
live000142.ts
#EXTINF:6.000,
live000143.ts
#EXTINF:6.000,
live000144.ts
```

### Process Management Considerations

1. **One FFmpeg per Network**: Each network has its own FFmpeg process
2. **Runs in Main Container**: FFmpeg worker runs inside the m3u-editor container (internal deployment)
3. **Local Storage**: HLS segments stored on local disk (no shared storage needed for single-server)
4. **Simple Count Limit**: Max concurrent broadcasting networks (e.g., 10)
5. **Graceful Shutdown**: SIGTERM to FFmpeg for clean exit
6. **Crash Recovery**: Detect and restart failed processes

---

## Implementation Order

| Phase | Description | Estimated Effort | Dependencies |
|-------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| 1 | Network Configuration | 1-2 hours | None |
| 2 | Storage & HLS Endpoint | 1-2 hours | Phase 1 |
| 3 | FFmpeg Process Management | 2-3 hours | Phase 2 |
| 4 | Schedule-Aware Streaming | 2-3 hours | Phase 3 |
| 5 | Background Worker | 2-3 hours | Phase 4 |
| 6 | Monitoring & UI | 2-3 hours | Phase 5 |
| 7 | Integration & Polish | 2-3 hours | Phase 6 |

**Total Estimated Effort**: 12-19 hours

---

## Questions to Resolve

1. ~~**Docker Considerations**~~: FFmpeg worker runs in main m3u-editor container ✓

2. ~~**Storage Location**~~: Local disk storage (single-server deployment) ✓

3. ~~**Max Concurrent Networks**~~: Simple count limit (e.g., max 10 broadcasting) ✓

4. **Viewer Tracking**: Do we need to track who's watching?

5. **DVR/Timeshift**: Future feature to allow rewinding live content?

---

## Future Roadmap

Features to consider for future phases:

### Bandwidth-Based Throttling
Instead of simple count limits, track actual bandwidth usage:
- Configure server network capacity (e.g., 1Gbps)
- Set percentage limit for broadcasts (e.g., 50%)
- System calculates available bandwidth dynamically
- Higher quality networks "cost more" capacity

### Multi-Server / Scaling
- Shared storage (NFS/S3) for HLS segments
- Load balancing across broadcast workers
- Centralized process coordination

### DVR / Timeshift
- Keep more HLS segments (hours instead of seconds)
- Allow clients to seek backwards in live stream
- Storage considerations for longer retention

---

## Getting Started

To begin Phase 1, run:

```bash
php artisan make:migration add_broadcast_settings_to_networks_table
```

Then update the Network model and Filament resource with the new fields.
